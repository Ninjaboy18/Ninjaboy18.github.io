    <td>When doing my poster i just started writing and it started from there really.I had to cancel out a lot of things and made it all the way down to 4 topics.At first i didn't think that was a lot of topics but i wrote what i felt and it turned out to be the best it homework i had done.</td>

    <td>Once i had figured out what i was going to write i then ran into another problem.Should i draw the pictures of should i print them.I looked at what he was grading us on and one of the main things was effort.After thinking about both points i think that drawing the pictures was best for this assignment as i could only do better.</td>
