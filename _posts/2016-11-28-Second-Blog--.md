    <td>I learned by observing the teacher's computer and all the basic code inputted into his github software. When going to change my coding i tried to add all the coding i could see and it worked.
At first i tried to copy the teacher then after getting the hang of it i started writing the blog by myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I often get distracted very easily and need to work on that habit. I get distracted because i haven't got the 100% focus i could have. If someone asks me for help or to do something i would do it because i think i am helping them but they are not learning themselves.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Looking back on the lesson i think I could've changed the way I acted and stopped helping people as much. If someone asked me for help i would say they aren't going to learn if someone else does it for them. I would change the fact that i ask too many questions and learn to pick things out myself which don't look quite right or in the wrong place and be more independent
