    <td>When we started to get on our computers we realised that the monitors were not working.We waited for about 10 minutes but they still didn't work we then had to watch mr keen show us what we were meant to do on the whiteboard.We the sort of drifted away and started to talk about different subject.</td>

    <td>Mr keen told us that nowadays kids think that they can get away with everything.Most of the class disagreed but we soon realised that what he said was right and he gave us an example.He said that if a boy was meant to have a race and didnt prepare.In the race if he stops halfway the teachers sooth his nerves and say he done really well.</td>

    <td>In theory little johnny didn't do well as he did not prepare and he didn't finish the race.However some schools still believe that everyone should get a prize.This degrades the winners confidence as he discovers that even if he comes first he will still get the same prize as everybody else.
