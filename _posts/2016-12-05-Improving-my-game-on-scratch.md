    <td>Today we learned how to make our game 100 percent real without any faults.In the lessson Mr Keen showed us diffrent ways the object was moving between the blocks.He then asked what is wrong and showed us the sequence to make it right.He reminded us that if anything small that is on our game that is faulty you cant let other people play it as i would be cheating.In addition we also learned how to add diffrent objects in so we can make them do something. </td>

    <td>This time around i pushed myself  to the limit but i need to work on becoming faster when inputting code and adding different variables.If i was to be faster i could get to the front quicker and then get a better view of what was going on and how to improve my game. Sometimes going slow is good as you can check if i have included all my code because i haven't then the game will break and i will have no game. Next week i should try to aim to manage my time.</td>

    <td>Looking back on the lesson if i were to change the way i handled the lesson i would be a lot quicker and cautious. Today for example we were making power pellets on our scratch games to boost our character when our teacher only put one pellet on the game.Some people were wondering why he only added one pellet down and he revealed that if he had added all the pellets down then i would be trial and error as if you had noticed that something in your code was wrong you would have to go back and delete all 200 of your pellets therefore wasting your time.</td>
