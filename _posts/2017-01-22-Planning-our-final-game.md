    <td>At first Mr keen showed us the retro game mario and told us that the basic games were the ones that we can make on scratch.Therefore we had to think of an original idea or combine two ideas with a twist.I chose the name rivalry and fused space invaders and pacman with a bit of asteroids in it as well.</td>

    <td>You are a blue ship that has to fight the evil red ship as you have a bitter "rivalry".However the red ship is more cunning and expects this so he deploys his secret weapons.Threats.They are ghosts or vampires who are programmed to kill me if i make physical contact with the threats.However you can collect life pellets and score pellets.</td>

    <td> For me I believe it will be the coding of the harder actions.Will be difficult for me to handle.Especially the fact that if i get one piece of coding wrong it can ruin or corrupt the whole game.I Believe that on this one particular occasion i will have to ask for help on code that i don't know otherwise i could break the game or get a section wrong and have to do it again.</td>
