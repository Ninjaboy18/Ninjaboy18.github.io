    <td>I came in late to the lesson as i was finishing up a guitar lesson but from what i gather from the advert was that there was a lady who was on some sort of mission to get a man to like him.I think this is ridiculous as how can the man focus when there are a thousand cameras pointing in his direction.</td>

    <td>The second advert was even more sad.it was a tv show about overweight people and every week the person who burned the least amount of calories would leave the show.Personally i find this diminishing as it just says you are not fit enough to be on this show.</td>
