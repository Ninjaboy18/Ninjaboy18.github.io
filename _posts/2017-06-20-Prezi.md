    <td>Today i thought we were going to be doing another media lesson but i was excited to hear that we were trying out prezi.The reason i was so happy was because i had used it before so it was familiar to me.We set up an account and started messing around and exploring it.</td>

    <td>The concept of prezi is powerpoint.You create presentations about anything you want on there.But you can choose what person you are so the presentation layout fits you.If you are a teacher the presentation layout will be different to a sales executive.It is much better than powerpoint in my opinion.</td>

    <td>I decided to do my presentation on the future.Many people are scared of the future because of global warming but what people do not realise is that there are good things as well.We could crack cancer and people with enough money can fly into space.It is not finished yet but it looks good so far.I added some icons in so it is not just all writing and i am very proud of my work.</td>
