    <td>I learnt how to code and finished changing my blog and also done a survey about things i am afraid of.I learned how to code simple things to make a programm work and i also learned that if in life you are given a option to do something you should do it.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My habits i need to work on is that i am sometimes a little bit lacking in confidence and give away too easily.I struggled with the coding at first which made me lack behind and made me work more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If i were to do this again i would try and do everything by myself and not ask my friend or the person who is sitting next to me for help.Even if i did get i wrong it would still be a learning curve because after all failing is good and you will always work your way around it.
