    <td>When the teacher was showing us some different games we were asked why the game was simple.Most people said that the game was just to destroy an asteroid.But then he uncovered more and more reasons why the game was actually difficult to code.This made us realise how you should never judge a game by the way it looks.</td>

    <td>When I create my game i need to try to be more creative and simple.The base of the game is to get from start to finish and layer it with obstacles and traps and power pellets.That way i can make my game more interesting. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time i will be more creative and try different things out.If it doesn't work then i can apply what i learned to my new game and make it as interesting.I will also beware as one wrong sequence could mess up the entire game.</td>
