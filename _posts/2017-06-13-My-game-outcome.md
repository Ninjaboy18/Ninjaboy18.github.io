    <td>Before we handed in our games i decided to fine tune everything.However when i opened my game the second level was not working.Then i had two options.I could remake the second level or then only have the first level.I decided,and it still annoys me to this day,that i could not risk it and stuck with the first level.At the time i thought it was the end of my game.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>M game was called rivalry.The concept was random but the gameplay was vintage.You were the blue spaceship called cosmo and you were order and your rival,who is your brother is omsoc who is chaos.Chaos knows that he will lose if he fights himself so he brings out his minions to do the work for him.You have to kill all the minions and then restore the balance.</td>

    <td>My mark ended up being four out of six.I am very happy with this mark because it shows that he understood my idea but my gameplay needed to be more eye catching.If i had more time i could of mastered the game and potentially got a six.But we can't have all the time in the world</td>
