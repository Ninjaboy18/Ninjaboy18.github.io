    <td>Today we had a new teacher.Mr Keen.We were learning python coding today We learned about syntax and what it is.We talked about how important spelling was and what different things meant.For example the number eight and the eight in the brackets were completely different.One was a variable and the other meant something to print.Then we were introduced to python coding.We set up an account and got going.</td>

    <td>Python coding is a programme where we have to input different pieces of code into the computer that are used in real life.The computer will scan it and say if you have passed the level and got the code right.You are asked to use things like saying you name or having a conversation with two pieces of code it was pretty self explanatory but your grammar had to be perfect.Something that i am notorious for getting wrong.Python looks fun but you need to be precise.</td>

    <td>Python was very hard at first but after a while I got the hang of it.There was a lot of room for error and sometimes I didn't get some parts and I needed to get and often seemed help.The teacher said that he would just repeat the question again and again.So I had to look for the answer.There was different sections with different levels.I finished the first lesson on section 1 level 10.For homework we are meant to do some more work on python.Overall I look forward to coding with python.</td>
