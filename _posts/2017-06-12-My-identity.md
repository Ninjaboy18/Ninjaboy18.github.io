    <td>In the lesson we were given homework to make a poster on our identities.Most of the class have social media and you 90% of the time only portray 1 side of your life.You can post the happy parts,like if you are on holiday.Or you can post the sad moments and never even show the slightest of enthusiasm.Either way it is unhealthy as it may undermine some people as they will think that they have a rubbish life.</td>

    <td>We were asked to do a poster about our identities and i freaked out.Even though i do have social media i still don't know whether i am a happy person or a sad one.However i looked through the different things i could talk about and laid it out.I asked some other people what i should talk about to get a different perspective.I even solved my social media problems.</td>

    <td>If i could do this project again i would definitely not be so stressed about it.For the future this was a great lesson as it taught me that you can do anything by simply being calm and committing to the piece of homework. </td>
