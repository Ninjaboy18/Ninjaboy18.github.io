  <tr>
    <td>I learned by watching what the teacher does and then copying it.Strategies that were effective was that as soon as we saw and learned the code Mr keen would send us off to copy what he had just done in order for us to remember. He showed us some additional techniques in case we used scratch again and we learned the ropes of making a game. This week i didn't get distracted as i knew everything i was doing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>When making the basic structure of the game i could've made sure i was a bit quicker so that i could see all of what the teacher was doing and maximise my learning.It is better to get myself on track rather than be a tiny bit behind but still manage to miss a crucial piece of infomation. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If i was to do this lesson again the thing that i would change was to push myself to do more. Today we were making games on scratch and i could be creative and try different things. Add obstacles, make my object do different things and just try. I believe the reason that i was so reluctant to trying new thing is that i was anxious that something would go wrong and that i would have to start again or that i would break something that i can't fix. I wish to change that next lesson.</td>
