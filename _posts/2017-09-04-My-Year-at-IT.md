My IT experience was the best! I learnt a lot more than I did in primary school.In challoners i learnt how to code and learnt general life lessons.When i started at challoners i thought the blog idea was a good idea.I could look back on this and see what i did in the past for future reference.If i forget the basics i think my blogs will help

Ithink that the making of the games on scratch was one of the best thing at year 7.It helped me understand how the best games are made.Even though they are simple they are more popular than many other complex games.Also the presentations that we made were very fun as we got to talk about different subjects.

Overall i think it has been a good year in year 7 and look forward to doing it all over again in year 8
