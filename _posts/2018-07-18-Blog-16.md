We'll use functions, lists, and conditionals to make our game.That was what i was aiming for in this lesson and i completed it and then got to play the battleships game myself.It turned out better than expected and filled me with confidence.</td>

    <td>One of my main weaknesses is that i take a lot of time to process and that causes a lot of problems in the lessons as i then take more time than needed on the task in hand and that is generally a problem that occurs many a time.I look to improve this in the coming weeks as we finish this project.</td>
