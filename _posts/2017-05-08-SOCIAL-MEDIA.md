    <td>When people tried to think of advantages it was a bit different.they were only thinking about the good things on the internet not social media.For example watching youtube is  not social media because you are watching someone post videos online but not really getting in touch with them.</td>

    <td>Different topic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>After we made the list we went down it and there were a lot of terms that people didn't know.We then started discussing the reason why we cannot vote and things like that.The actual reason why is that the government think we are not mature enough to vote or something like that because we will just be silly</td>
