    <td>Today we had a new lesson on a new topic.Media.We always use it,for sport,news and in my own opinion the most frequently used and some would say most important,social media.Most people use it but we were told that not everything we hear is one hundred percent true.</td>

    <td>Nowadays media can be one of the most unreliable sources of news because of the amount of exaggeration used.Over the past few years certain words have become word that people use in everyday manor.Black people,White people and any other race are starting to use words that a few years ago if said you would be arrested are now used in everyday lives.</td>

    <td> Youtube is a prime example of how people get hurt or worse.When kids go on the most trending page and they see something "cool" they instantly think that they should do it.Say the fire fairy challenge.Go into the kitchen at night and turn the gas on and throw a match into it.You may think this a stupid thing to do and are laughing but if you go online and see how many pictures there are of kids skin getting burnt of you would be horrified.Obviously media is most of the time true you have to make sure sometimes something is okay to watch.</td>
